    <h1>QUICK COCONUT DAL with tomato sambol</h1>

    <h3>For the dal /</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp rapeseed oil</li>
        <li>1 red onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>10 fresh curry leaves, plus extra to serve</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 green finger chilli, very finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 lemongrass stick, cut in half on an angle</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick, broken in half</li>
        <li>150g red lentils</li>
        <li>¹⁄³ tsp ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 x 400ml tin of coconut milk</li>
        <li>1¼ tsp salt</li>
        <li>½ tbsp lime (from ½ a lime)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the tomato sambol /</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>40g desiccated coconut</li>
        <li>1 long red chilli, very finely chopped</li>
        <li>100g cherry tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tbsp lime juice (from 1 lime)</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt”</li>
    </ul>


    Warm a tablespoon of oil in a medium-sized saucepan over a medium heat and add three-quarters of the onion (reserve the rest for the sambol), the curry leaves, garlic, chilli, lemongrass and cinnamon stick. Fry for 5 minutes, then stir in the lentils and turmeric. Add the coconut milk and 400ml of water (fill up the empty coconut tin to measure this) and tip it into the pan. Bring the mixture to the boil and simmer for around 20 to 25 minutes, until the lentils are no longer chalky and are tender to the bite. Add more water if it’s too thick, then season with the salt and lime.
    
    While the dal is cooking, make the sambol. Place the desiccated coconut into a pretty heatproof bowl. Pour in 3 tablespoons of freshly boiled water and stir to mix. Add the reserved onion, chilli, tomatoes, lime and salt. Mix, taste, and add more salt to balance if need be.
    
    To serve, fish the cinnamon and lemongrass pieces out of the dal, if you wish, and transfer to a serving bowl. Warm the final tablespoon of oil in a pan over a high heat, and when very hot add a handful of curry leaves and wait for them to crisp up, then take off the heat. Place the sambol over the top or serve on the side and tip the curry leaves over the top of the dal. Serve with rice or paratha
